# SQL_query_Generator
This project is about how to build an AI/LLM agent capable of understanding user's request and responsing to that by querying to SQL database.  
To accomplised this assessment, I referenced the following materials:
- [[SQL agent with Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/sql/agents?fbclid=IwAR1feCLF6ocWldzjBo8EeJakpzMdkTAMNManyZrYYcc0qpTN5ZUcGUUuP2A_aem_ATlqnACZkWhVpYBZwDfUc-cQ2SB9Ieo8vBASqm0hosw7Db6hURLY_VkJvwgeT4OswS9TWHL0u9ZC8FvJYwf9Ji_p)]
- [[My best friend - Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)]
